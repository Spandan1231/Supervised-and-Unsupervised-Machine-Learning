This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to two different tasks. 

In Task 1, the objective was to predict students' marks percentage based on the number of hours studied. To achieve this, supervised machine learning was employed, which is a type of learning where the model is trained using labeled data. The model was trained on a labeled dataset and was able to accurately predict students' marks percentage based on the number of hours studied.

Task 2 involved the analysis of the well-known Iris dataset using unsupervised clustering. Unsupervised learning is a type of learning where the model is trained without labeled data. The objective of this task was to gain insights into the structure and relationships among the features in the Iris dataset. The results of the unsupervised clustering analysis provided a clear understanding of the relationships among the features in the dataset, and helped in identifying patterns and groups within the data.
